# SlopperEngine
SlopperEngine is a fully C# game engine, designed to be flexible and performant.
It supports 3D rendering, physics, basic 2D UI, serialization, and clean "scripting".
Planned features are a fully custom shading language, an editor, scalable multithreading, and builtin modding support.

For more information about the design, check out the "Design Justification.md" file.
If you're interested in contributing, check out "Style Guide.md" instead.
