# SlopperEngine
SlopperEngine is a fully C# game engine, designed to be flexible and performant.
It supports 3D rendering, physics, basic 2D UI, serialization, and clean "scripting".
Planned features are a fully custom shading language, an editor, scalable multithreading, and builtin modding support.

To check out the engine, try looking at the SillyDemos namespace (SlopperEngine/SillyDemos/) 
which shows basic code for how to use the engine.
For more information about the design, check out the "Design justification.md" file.
